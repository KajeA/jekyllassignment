I"Ñ<p>Highly Recommended Metal Releases of 2018
#5 None â€“ Life Has Gone On Long Enough (Atmospheric Black from USA) â€œFuzzy distortion and depressive vocals lure you into the bleak world of misery and grief and swallow you. You can feel yourself being sucked into a desolate wasteland and caressed by a shroud of doom.â€</p>

<p>#4 Orbit Culture â€“ Redfog (Melodic Death from Sweden) â€œThis distinctive and intuitive take on melodic modern metal is slathered with crushing guitar work, catchy lyrics and undaunted emotion that challenges genre boundaries and exceeds expectationsâ€</p>

<p>#3 Nekrokraft â€“ Servants (Black/Thrash from Sweden) â€œPower, melody and evil combine to make a fucking great album, nothing is overdone, there is no cheese, tâ€™s just pure unadulterated blackened death metal with inescapable trash overtones.â€</p>

<p>#2 Shylmagoghnar â€“ Transience (Atmospheric Black/Death from Nederlands) â€œCoarse reverberating vocals will send chills up your spine as you are sucked into the austere atmospheric black metal that is both jarring and soothing. Unrelenting intricacies juxtaposed against the symphonic riffs meld with the harsh vocals for a flawless release.</p>

<p>#1 Altars of Grief â€“ Iris (Blackened Doom from Canada) â€œSolace can be found momentarily in the cello, and the melancholy riffs before being abruptly torn from meditation and thrown in a chaotic downward spiral of chaos and confusion.â€</p>
