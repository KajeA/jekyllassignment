I"Ò<p>At first glance of the album cover for Fight Till The End, complete with a word art looking logo, clashing title font on top of artwork depicting  a knight fighting a dragon, you know what exactly what lies in wait under that cover. Itâ€™s no secret that I usually lump most traditional heavy metal under the heading of entirely cheeseballs, (along with all power metal and trve kvlt black metal â€“ crucify me), but I do truly enjoy a band that doesnâ€™t take themselves overly serious and can have fun with their art in their chosen sub genre.</p>

<p>Whether or not Steel Night is one of those bands that takes themselves too seriously, I canâ€™t say for certain, but I will hand it to them that Fight Till The End is a really fun album. Itâ€™s the classic sound that is expected form the genre with the added bonus of having a singer (Jahaziel Rangel) who can use his full vocal range with relentless power that never wavers.</p>
