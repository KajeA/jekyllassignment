I"ÿ<p>At long last my most anticipated album of the year has been released. Considering INSOMNIUMâ€™s last two releases have topped my year end lists, its reasonable to say my expectations were extremely high. This is classic INSOMNIUM album, thereâ€™s no experimentation, itâ€™s consistent with their previous releases with all the elements that Iâ€™ve come to expect from the band. Itâ€™s like being wrapped up in your favourite reassuring blanket, comfortable and familiar. You know exactly what to expect.</p>
