I")<p>At first glance of the album cover for Fight Till The End, complete with a word art looking logo, clashing title font on top of artwork depicting  a knight fighting a dragon, you know what exactly what lies in wait under that cover. It’s no secret that I usually lump most traditional heavy metal under the heading of entirely cheeseballs, (along with all power metal and trve kvlt black metal – crucify me), but I do truly enjoy a band that doesn’t take themselves overly serious and can have fun with their art in their chosen sub genre.</p>
