I"k<p>About Me</p>

<p>Raised in Alberta, Canada on a strict diet of country music and religious conservatism, it didn’t take me long to reject the status quo, and set out on a journey filled with ‘the devil’s music’. While I consider myself open minded across genres, heavy metal is the prominent provider for the soundtrack of my life. From the bleak reverberations of depressive black metal to the energizing, uplifting fanfare of power metal, there is metal for all occasions.</p>

<p>I started putting on music events in 2008 after working in a live music venue and being reintroduced to the energy that comes with experiencing music up front and personal. Several years as a stage hand, followed by university and college with majors in sound, lighting, costumes and events management further solidified my passion for being involved in the show biz industry.</p>
