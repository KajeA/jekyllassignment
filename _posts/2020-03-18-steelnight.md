At first glance of the album cover for Fight Till The End, complete with a word art looking logo, clashing title font on top of artwork depicting  a knight fighting a dragon, you know what exactly what lies in wait under that cover. It’s no secret that I usually lump most traditional heavy metal under the heading of entirely cheeseballs, (along with all power metal and trve kvlt black metal – crucify me), but I do truly enjoy a band that doesn’t take themselves overly serious and can have fun with their art in their chosen sub genre. 

Whether or not Steel Night is one of those bands that takes themselves too seriously, I can’t say for certain, but I will hand it to them that Fight Till The End is a really fun album. It’s the classic sound that is expected form the genre with the added bonus of having a singer (Jahaziel Rangel) who can use his full vocal range with relentless power that never wavers.
