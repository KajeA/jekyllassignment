      <p>Highly Recommended Metal Releases of 2018
#5 None – Life Has Gone On Long Enough (Atmospheric Black from USA) “Fuzzy distortion and depressive vocals lure you into the bleak world of misery and grief and swallow you. You can feel yourself being sucked into a desolate wasteland and caressed by a shroud of doom.”</p>

      <h2><a href="/2020/03/20/goatsperm.html">Goat Sperm</a></h2>
      <p>September is Month of the Goat! I picked four recent releases that all include ‘goat’ in the name to see how these capra inspired bands stack up. I’ve included a completely arbitrary ranking system for this batch as well.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2020/03/20/aeonsabyss.html">Aeons Abyss</a></h2>
      <p>Aeons Abyss is an Australian death metal studio project that has been around since 2017, and have now finished their first full length Impenitent slated for release in November. Apparently the music for this album has been written since the mid 1990’s and it was simmering for over a decade when it would finally be unearthed and unleashed around the world.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2020/03/19/insomnium.html">Insomnium</a></h2>
      <p>At long last my most anticipated album of the year has been released. Considering INSOMNIUM’s last two releases have topped my year end lists, its reasonable to say my expectations were extremely high. This is classic INSOMNIUM album, there’s no experimentation, it’s consistent with their previous releases with all the elements that I’ve come to expect from the band. It’s like being wrapped up in your favourite reassuring blanket, comfortable and familiar. You know exactly what to expect.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2020/03/18/steelnight.html">Steel Night</a></h2>
      <p>At first glance of the album cover for Fight Till The End, complete with a word art looking logo, clashing title font on top of artwork depicting  a knight fighting a dragon, you know what exactly what lies in wait under that cover. It’s no secret that I usually lump most traditional heavy metal under the heading of entirely cheeseballs, (along with all power metal and trve kvlt black metal – crucify me), but I do truly enjoy a band that doesn’t take themselves overly serious and can have fun with their art in their chosen sub genre.</p>
