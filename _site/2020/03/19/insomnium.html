      <p>At long last my most anticipated album of the year has been released. Considering INSOMNIUM’s last two releases have topped my year end lists, its reasonable to say my expectations were extremely high. This is classic INSOMNIUM album, there’s no experimentation, it’s consistent with their previous releases with all the elements that I’ve come to expect from the band. It’s like being wrapped up in your favourite reassuring blanket, comfortable and familiar. You know exactly what to expect.</p>

<p>From the beginning it’s a wash of agonized aggression, melancholic longing and haunted whispers edged with dreamy guitar solos. Easing in the album with a delicate intro is “Wail of the North”, peaceful and serene, it ushers into the next seventy minutes of Finnish melodic death at its finest. This album includes new guitarist Jani Liimatainen who also takes on clean vocal duties and the change is personal has no negative impact on the material.</p>

<p>“Valedictorian” is a classic INSOMNIUM track, with the clean vocals adding an extra layer of melody with the harsh vocals and the desperate backing vocals breaking against a wall of flawless guitar work. A personal highlight of INSOMNIUM’s music has always been how they can take a musical interlude inject it with so much melodic depth that the paused vocals go unnoticed.</p>
